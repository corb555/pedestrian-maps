* Tracestrack Maps

  The maps are derived from [[https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto][gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto]].

* Goals

  The maps aim to be avant-garde and progressive, i.e. willing to change and
  support new tags. However there are some guidelines in general:

  1. similar to osm-carto so that users can cross-reference and understand
     without much context switching.
  2. general and balanced to everyday use. For example, no street_lamp or power
     lines as they are less useful and clutter the maps.
  3. for Topo map, priority should be given to outdoor activities.
  4. maintaining similarity and relevance between Carto and Topo.

* Issue reports

  You are welcome to open issues about styling and tag support for Carto, Topo
  and Label maps.

* Setup

  Please setup a same enviroment as described in
  [[https://github.com/gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto][gravitystorm/openstreetmap-carto]]. For working with DEM data, please refer to
  [[https://github.com/der-stefan/OpenTopoMap/blob/master/mapnik/HOWTO_DEM.md][der-stefan/OpenTopoMap]]. Setting up the enviroment requires some decent Linux
  and GIS knowledge and won't be covered in this repository.
